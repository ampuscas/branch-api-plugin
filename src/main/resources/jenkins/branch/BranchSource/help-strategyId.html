    <b>Initial Index Build Prevention</b> modifies the indexing behavior so that any branches, pull requests, and tags discovered during the initial indexing create a Pipeline, but will not build it. The pipeline will remain inactive until an SCM event has been made to its corresponding branch/PR/tag.
